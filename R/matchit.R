#' @description
#' `matchit()` is the main function of *MatchIt* and performs
#' pairing, subset selection, and subclassification with the aim of creating
#' treatment and control groups balanced on included covariates. *MatchIt*
#' implements the suggestions of Ho, Imai, King, and Stuart (2007) for
#' improving parametric statistical models by preprocessing data with
#' nonparametric matching methods.
#'
#' This page documents the overall use of `matchit()`, but for specifics
#' of how `matchit()` works with individual matching methods, see the
#' individual pages linked in the Details section below.
#'
#' @param formula a two-sided [`formula`] object containing the treatment and
#' covariates to be used in creating the distance measure used in the matching.
#' This formula will be supplied to the functions that estimate the distance
#' measure. The formula should be specified as `A ~ X1 + X2 + ...` where
#' `A` represents the treatment variable and `X1` and `X2` are
#' covariates.
#' @param data a data frame containing the variables named in `formula`
#' and possible other arguments. If not found in `data`, the variables
#' will be sought in the environment.
#' @param method the matching method to be used. The allowed methods are
#' [`"nearest"`][method_nearest] for nearest neighbor matching (on
#' the propensity score by default), [`"optimal"`][method_optimal]
#' for optimal pair matching, [`"full"`][method_full] for optimal
#' full matching, [`"genetic"`][method_genetic] for genetic
#' matching, [`"cem"`][method_cem] for coarsened exact matching,
#' [`"exact"`][method_exact] for exact matching,
#' [`"cardinality"`][method_cardinality] for cardinality and
#' template matching, and [`"subclass"`][method_subclass] for
#' subclassification. When set to `NULL`, no matching will occur, but
#' propensity score estimation and common support restrictions will still occur
#' if requested. See the linked pages for each method for more details on what
#' these methods do, how the arguments below are used by each on, and what
#' additional arguments are allowed.
#' @param distance the distance measure to be used. Can be either the name of a
#' method of estimating propensity scores (e.g., `"glm"`), the name of a
#' method of computing a distance matrix from the covariates (e.g.,
#' `"mahalanobis"`), a vector of already-computed distance measures, or a
#' matrix of pairwise distances. See [`distance`] for allowable
#' options. The default is `"glm"` for propensity scores estimated with
#' logistic regression using [glm()]. Ignored for some methods; see individual
#' methods pages for information on whether and how the distance measure is
#' used.
#' @param link when `distance` is specified as a string, an additional
#' argument controlling the link function used in estimating the distance
#' measure. Allowable options depend on the specific `distance` value
#' specified. See [`distance`] for allowable options with each
#' option. The default is `"logit"`, which, along with `distance = "glm"`, identifies the default measure as logistic regression propensity
#' scores.
#' @param distance.options a named list containing additional arguments
#' supplied to the function that estimates the distance measure as determined
#' by the argument to `distance`. See [distance] for an
#' example of its use.
#' @param estimand a string containing the name of the target estimand desired.
#' Can be one of `"ATT"` or `"ATC"`. Some methods accept `"ATE"`
#' as well. Default is `"ATT"`. See Details and the individual methods
#' pages for information on how this argument is used.
#' @param exact for methods that allow it, for which variables exact matching
#' should take place. Can be specified as a string containing the names of
#' variables in `data` to be used or a one-sided formula with the desired
#' variables on the right-hand side (e.g., `~ X3 + X4`). See the
#' individual methods pages for information on whether and how this argument is
#' used.
#' @param mahvars for methods that allow it, on which variables Mahalanobis
#' distance matching should take place when `distance` corresponds to
#' propensity scores. Usually used to perform Mahalanobis distance matching
#' within propensity score calipers, where the propensity scores are computed
#' using `formula` and `distance`. Can be specified as a string
#' containing the names of variables in `data` to be used or a one-sided
#' formula with the desired variables on the right-hand side (e.g., `~ X3 + X4`). See the individual methods pages for information on whether and how
#' this argument is used.
#' @param antiexact for methods that allow it, for which variables anti-exact
#' matching should take place. Anti-exact matching ensures paired individuals
#' do not have the same value of the anti-exact matching variable(s). Can be
#' specified as a string containing the names of variables in `data` to be
#' used or a one-sided formula with the desired variables on the right-hand
#' side (e.g., `~ X3 + X4`). See the individual methods pages for
#' information on whether and how this argument is used.
#' @param discard a string containing a method for discarding units outside a
#' region of common support. When a propensity score is estimated or supplied
#' to `distance` as a vector, the options are `"none"`,
#' `"treated"`, `"control"`, or `"both"`. For `"none"`, no
#' units are discarded for common support. Otherwise, units whose propensity
#' scores fall outside the corresponding region are discarded. Can also be a
#' `logical` vector where `TRUE` indicates the unit is to be
#' discarded. Default is `"none"` for no common support restriction. See
#' Details.
#' @param reestimate if `discard` is not `"none"` and propensity
#' scores are estimated, whether to re-estimate the propensity scores in the
#' remaining sample. Default is `FALSE` to use the propensity scores
#' estimated in the original sample.
#' @param s.weights an optional numeric vector of sampling weights to be
#' incorporated into propensity score models and balance statistics. Can also
#' be specified as a string containing the name of variable in `data` to
#' be used or a one-sided formula with the variable on the right-hand side
#' (e.g., `~ SW`). Not all propensity score models accept sampling
#' weights; see [distance] for information on which do and do not,
#' and see `vignette("sampling-weights")` for details on how to use
#' sampling weights in a matching analysis.
#' @param replace for methods that allow it, whether matching should be done
#' with replacement (`TRUE`), where control units are allowed to be
#' matched to several treated units, or without replacement (`FALSE`),
#' where control units can only be matched to one treated unit each. See the
#' individual methods pages for information on whether and how this argument is
#' used. Default is `FALSE` for matching without replacement.
#' @param m.order for methods that allow it, the order that the matching takes
#' place. Allowable options depend on the matching method. The default of
#' `NULL` corresponds to `"largest"` when a propensity score is
#' estimated or supplied as a vector and `"data"` otherwise.
#' @param caliper for methods that allow it, the width(s) of the caliper(s) to
#' use in matching. Should be a numeric vector with each value named according
#' to the variable to which the caliper applies. To apply to the distance
#' measure, the value should be unnamed. See the individual methods pages for
#' information on whether and how this argument is used. The default is
#' `NULL` for no caliper.
#' @param std.caliper `logical`; when a caliper is specified, whether the
#' the caliper is in standard deviation units (`TRUE`) or raw units
#' (`FALSE`). Can either be of length 1, applying to all calipers, or of
#' length equal to the length of `caliper`. Default is `TRUE`.
#' @param ratio for methods that allow it, how many control units should be
#' matched to each treated unit in k:1 matching. Should be a single integer
#' value. See the individual methods pages for information on whether and how
#' this argument is used. The default is 1 for 1:1 matching.
#' @param verbose `logical`; whether information about the matching
#' process should be printed to the console. What is printed depends on the
#' matching method. Default is `FALSE` for no printing other than
#' warnings.
#' @param include.obj `logical`; whether to include any objects created in
#' the matching process in the output, i.e., by the functions from other
#' packages `matchit()` calls. What is included depends on the matching
#' method. Default is `FALSE`.
#' @param \dots additional arguments passed to the functions used in the
#' matching process. See the individual methods pages for information on what
#' additional arguments are allowed for each method. Ignored for `print()`.
#' @param x a `matchit` object.
#'
#' @details
#' Details for the various matching methods can be found at the following help
#' pages:
#' * [`method_nearest`] for nearest neighbor matching
#' * [`method_optimal`] for optimal pair matching
#' * [`method_full`] for optimal full matching
#' * [`method_genetic`] for genetic matching
#' * [`method_cem`] for coarsened exact matching
#' * [`method_exact`] for exact matching
#' * [`method_cardinality`] for cardinality and template matching
#' * [`method_subclass`] for subclassification
#'
#' The pages contain information on what the method does, which of the arguments above are
#' allowed with them and how they are interpreted, and what additional
#' arguments can be supplied to further tune the method. Note that the default
#' method with no arguments supplied other than `formula` and `data`
#' is 1:1 nearest neighbor matching without replacement on a propensity score
#' estimated using a logistic regression of the treatment on the covariates.
#' This is not the same default offered by other matching programs, such as
#' those in *Matching*, `teffects` in Stata, or `PROC PSMATCH`
#' in SAS, so care should be taken if trying to replicate the results of those
#' programs.
#'
#' When `method = NULL`, no matching will occur, but any propensity score
#' estimation and common support restriction will. This can be a simple way to
#' estimate the propensity score for use in future matching specifications
#' without having to re-estimate it each time. The `matchit()` output with
#' no matching can be supplied to `summary()` to examine balance prior to
#' matching on any of the included covariates and on the propensity score if
#' specified. All arguments other than `distance`, `discard`, and
#' `reestimate` will be ignored.
#'
#' See [distance] for details on the several ways to
#' specify the `distance`, `link`, and `distance.options`
#' arguments to estimate propensity scores and create distance measures.
#'
#' When the treatment variable is not a `0/1` variable, it will be coerced
#' to one and returned as such in the `matchit()` output (see section
#' Value, below). The following rules are used: 1) if `0` is one of the
#' values, it will be considered the control and the other value the treated;
#' 2) otherwise, if the variable is a factor, `levels(treat)[1]` will be
#' considered control and the other variable the treated; 3) otherwise,
#' `sort(unique(treat))[1]` will be considered control and the other value
#' the treated. It is safest to ensure the treatment variable is a `0/1`
#' variable.
#'
#' The `discard` option implements a common support restriction. It can
#' only be used when a distance measure is an estimated propensity score or supplied as a vector and is ignored for some matching
#' methods. When specified as `"treated"`, treated units whose distance
#' measure is outside the range of distance measures of the control units will
#' be discarded. When specified as `"control"`, control units whose
#' distance measure is outside the range of distance measures of the treated
#' units will be discarded. When specified as `"both"`, treated and
#' control units whose distance measure is outside the intersection of the
#' range of distance measures of the treated units and the range of distance
#' measures of the control units will be discarded. When `reestimate = TRUE` and `distance` corresponds to a propensity score-estimating
#' function, the propensity scores are re-estimated in the remaining units
#' prior to being used for matching or calipers.
#'
#' Caution should be used when interpreting effects estimated with various
#' values of `estimand`. Setting `estimand = "ATT"` doesn't
#' necessarily mean the average treatment effect in the treated is being
#' estimated; it just means that for matching methods, treated units will be
#' untouched and given weights of 1 and control units will be matched to them
#' (and the opposite for `estimand = "ATC"`). If a caliper is supplied or
#' treated units are removed for common support or some other reason (e.g.,
#' lacking matches when using exact matching), the actual estimand targeted is
#' not the ATT but the treatment effect in the matched sample. The argument to
#' `estimand` simply triggers which units are matched to which, and for
#' stratification-based methods (exact matching, CEM, full matching, and
#' subclassification), determines the formula used to compute the
#' stratification weights.
#'
#' ## How Matching Weights Are Computed
#'
#' Matching weights are computed in one of two ways depending on whether matching was done with replacement
#' or not.
#'
#' For matching *without* replacement (except for cardinality matching), each
#' unit is assigned to a subclass, which represents the pair they are a part of
#' (in the case of k:1 matching) or the stratum they belong to (in the case of
#' exact matching, coarsened exact matching, full matching, or
#' subclassification). The formula for computing the weights depends on the
#' argument supplied to `estimand`. A new "stratum propensity score"
#' (`sp`) is computed as the proportion of units in each stratum that are
#' in the treated group, and all units in that stratum are assigned that
#' stratum propensity score. This is distinct from the propensity score used for matching, if any. Weights are then computed using the standard formulas for
#' inverse probability weights with the stratum propensity score inserted: for the ATT, weights are 1 for the treated
#' units and `sp/(1-sp)` for the control units; for the ATC, weights are
#' `(1-sp)/sp` for the treated units and 1 for the control units; for the
#' ATE, weights are `1/sp` for the treated units and `1/(1-sp)` for the
#' control units. For cardinality matching, all matched units receive a weight
#' of 1.
#'
#' For matching *with* replacement, units are not assigned to unique strata. For
#' the ATT, each treated unit gets a weight of 1. Each control unit is weighted
#' as the sum of the inverse of the number of control units matched to the same
#' treated unit across its matches. For example, if a control unit was matched
#' to a treated unit that had two other control units matched to it, and that
#' same control was matched to a treated unit that had one other control unit
#' matched to it, the control unit in question would get a weight of 1/3 + 1/2
#' = 5/6. For the ATC, the same is true with the treated and control labels
#' switched. The weights are computed using the `match.matrix` component
#' of the `matchit()` output object.
#'
#' In each treatment group, weights are divided by the mean of the nonzero
#' weights in that treatment group to make the weights sum to the number of
#' units in that treatment group. If sampling weights are included through the
#' `s.weights` argument, they will be included in the `matchit()`
#' output object but not incorporated into the matching weights.
#' [match.data()], which extracts the matched set from a `matchit` object,
#' combines the matching weights and sampling weights.
#'
#' @return When `method` is something other than `"subclass"`, a
#' `matchit` object with the following components:
#'
#' \item{match.matrix}{a matrix containing the matches. The rownames correspond
#' to the treated units and the values in each row are the names (or indices)
#' of the control units matched to each treated unit. When treated units are
#' matched to different numbers of control units (e.g., with exact matching or
#' matching with a caliper), empty spaces will be filled with `NA`. Not
#' included when `method` is `"full"`, `"cem"` (unless `k2k
#' = TRUE`), `"exact"`, or `"cardinality"`.}
#' \item{subclass}{a factor
#' containing matching pair/stratum membership for each unit. Unmatched units
#' will have a value of `NA`. Not included when `replace = TRUE`.}
#' \item{weights}{a numeric vector of estimated matching weights. Unmatched and
#' discarded units will have a weight of zero.}
#' \item{model}{the fit object of
#' the model used to estimate propensity scores when `distance` is
#' specified and not `"mahalanobis"` or a numeric vector. When
#' `reestimate = TRUE`, this is the model estimated after discarding
#' units.}
#' \item{X}{a data frame of covariates mentioned in `formula`,
#' `exact`, `mahvars`, and `antiexact`.}
#' \item{call}{the `matchit()` call.}
#' \item{info}{information on the matching method and
#' distance measures used.}
#' \item{estimand}{the argument supplied to
#' `estimand`.}
#' \item{formula}{the `formula` supplied.}
#' \item{treat}{a vector of treatment status converted to zeros (0) and ones
#' (1) if not already in that format.}
#' \item{distance}{a vector of distance
#' values (i.e., propensity scores) when `distance` is supplied as a
#' method of estimating propensity scores or a numeric vector.}
#' \item{discarded}{a logical vector denoting whether each observation was
#' discarded (`TRUE`) or not (`FALSE`) by the argument to
#' `discard`.}
#' \item{s.weights}{the vector of sampling weights supplied to
#' the `s.weights` argument, if any.}
#' \item{exact}{a one-sided formula
#' containing the variables, if any, supplied to `exact`.}
#' \item{mahvars}{a one-sided formula containing the variables, if any,
#' supplied to `mahvars`.}
#' \item{obj}{when `include.obj = TRUE`, an
#' object containing the intermediate results of the matching procedure. See
#' the individual methods pages for what this component will contain.}
#'
#' When `method = "subclass"`, a `matchit.subclass` object with the same
#' components as above except that `match.matrix` is excluded and one
#' additional component, `q.cut`, is included, containing a vector of the
#' distance measure cutpoints used to define the subclasses. See
#' [`method_subclass`] for details.
